A pair of functions

	freezeColors 	Converts indexed images into [r g b] making them immune to changes in the colormap.
	unfreezeColors 	Restores the original indexed image, allowing the colormap and caxis to again affect the image. 

DESCRIPTION

Problem: There is only one colormap per figure, so all images share the same colormap. Often one wants different colormaps.

Solution: This function pair provides an easy way to have images using different colomaps in the same figure.

Example:
subplot(2,1,1)
imagesc(X)
colormap hot
freezeColors

subplot(2,1,2)
imagesc(Y)
colormap hsv
etc...

Note, you can also pass a handle to freezeColors. This is useful if you'd like to freeze the colors of a colorbar:

h=colorbar;
freezeColors(h), or simply:
freezeColors(colorbar)
