function  folds = Kfold(N, K)
% Kfold Compute indices for K-fold cross validaiton
% folds = Kfold(N,K)
% N = num data
% K = num folds
% folds{i} = indices of i'th fold
%
% Example:
% folds = Kfold(100, 3)
% folds{1} = 1:33, folds{2} = 34:66, folds{3} = 67:100
% (last fold gets all the left over so has different length)
